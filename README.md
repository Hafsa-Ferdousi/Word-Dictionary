# Word Dictionary

This project is a simple Dictionary Application in C++ that stores words and their meanings using a Binary Search Tree (BST). If a searched word is not found, the program suggests similar words based on prefix or postfix matching. 

## Features
### Add Word
Insert new word and its meaning into the dictionary.
### Search Word
Search for a word and display its meaning.If not found, the program suggests similar words based on:

Prefix matching (first 3 letters)

Postfix matching (last 3 letters)

### Delete Word

Delete a word from the dictionary.

### Display All Words
Print all words in alphabetical order with their meanings.

#### Load Words From File
Reads words and meanings from a text file to populate the dictionary.

## Concepts Used
#### Binary Search Tree (BST)
#### Inorder Traversal
#### Linked List 
#### Recursion
#### File Handling

#### Reading words and meanings from a file

#### String Operations

#### Substring

#### Prefix/postfix matching

## Advantages 
Fast search because of BST

Sorted output automatically

Suggestions help fix typos

Easy to load data from file

Good demonstration of recursion

## Future Improvements
Save changes back to the file

Add synonyms

Create a GUI interface

Improve suggestion logic with spell-checking

## Summary

The Word Dictionary is a simple yet powerful C++ application that uses a Binary Search Tree to store and manage words with their meanings. It provides fast searches, alphabetical listing, and intelligent suggestions for misspelled words based on prefix or postfix matching. This project is a practical demonstration of data structures, recursion, and file handling, and serves as a solid base for further enhancements like file persistence, synonym support, and a graphical user interface.
